                               OF THE
                               VOYAGE
                               OF THE

                              FROM THE
                    River _Thames_ to _New-England_,

                 Near which Place she was cast away on
               _Boon-Island_, December 11, 1710. by the
                 Captain's Obstinacy, who endeavour'd
               to betray her to the _French_, or run her
               ashore; with an Account of the Falsehoods
                    in the Captain's _Narrative_.

            And a faithful Relation of the Extremities the
                Company was reduc'd to for Twenty-four
                Days on that desolate Rock, where they
              were forc'd to eat one of their Companions
                who died, but were at last wonderfully
                            deliver'd.

                  The whole attested upon Oath, by

                   _Christopher Langman_, Mate;

                              THE
                            PREFACE.


_We having been Sufferers in this unfortunate Voyage, had reason to
believe, from the Temper of our Captain, who treated us barbarously
both by Sea and Land, that he would misrepresent the Matter, as we now
find he has done in a late Pamphlet by him publish'd, intituled_, A
Narrative of the Sufferings, Preservation, and Deliverance of Captain
_John Dean_, and Company, in the _Nottingham_ Galley of _London_,
&c. London, _Printed by_ R. Tooky, _and Sold by_ S. Popping _at the_
Raven _in_ Pater-noster-Row, _and at the_ Printing Press _under the_
Royal-Exchange.

_Our Apprehensions of this made us refuse the Encouragement which was
offered us in_ New England, _and resolve to come home that we might
have an Opportunity to lay before the World, and before those Gentlemen
and others who have lost their Estates and Relations in this unhappy
Voyage, the true Causes of our own and their Misfortunes, and how they
might, humanely speaking, have been easily avoided, had Captain_ Dean
_been either an honest or an able Commander. This we think ourselves
oblig'd to do in common Justice, and to prevent others from suffering
by him in the like manner._

_We cannot but in the first place take notice of a notorious Falshood
he asserts in his Preface_. That he might have had the Attestation of
several of his Fellow Sufferers now in Town to the Truth of what he has
wrote, _since he very well knows that Two of us did positively refuse
it in publick Company, after reading a part of it, and told him to his
Face_, that it was not true.

_In the next place, as to what he says of_ the Encouragement his
Narrative met with in _New England_ and _North Britain_, where it
appeared under much greater Disadvantages as to the Particulars and
Dress, _We think fit to reply, That the Acceptance it met with in_
New England _was occasion'd by our being confined from appearing in
publick during our Sickness, and that he compell'd us to sign what
our Illness made us uncapable to understand; but when it pleas'd God
that we recover'd our Health, and made our Affidavits here subjoin'd
before Mr._ Penhallow, _a Justice of Peace, and Member of Council at_
Portsmouth _in the Province of_ New Hampshire, New England, _in the
Presence of the said_ Dean, _who had not the Face to deny it, his
Character appear'd in a true Light, and he was cover'd with Shame and
Confusion_.

_The Captain has reason indeed to commend the Charity of the Gentlemen
of_ New England, _which is no more than their due, both from him and
us, tho' we were unhappily deprived of the chief Effects of it by the
Captain's Brother; who being the Person that received it, took care not
to be wanting to the Captain and himself, whereas we had nothing but
what was fit for such miserable Wretches, who were glad of any thing,
since we were then uncapable of working for better._

_As to what he says in his Postscript about Insurance, we know nothing
further of that matter than what we heard on Board, as will appear by
our Narrative, viz._ That there were great Sums insured upon the Ship,
_the truth of which is more proper for the Inquiry of others than us
who are only Sailors._

_We come now to the Narrative, wherein we shall represent nothing but
the Truth, of which we our selves had the Misfortune to be Witnesses,
to our great Sorrow, and the manifest Danger of our Lives._

_And since what we deliver is upon Oath, we hope it will obtain Credit
sooner than the bare Word of Captain_ Dean, _his Brother, and Mr._
Whitworth, _who were all Three interested Persons, and but One of them
acquainted with all the Matter of Fact, which for his own Reputation
and Safety he has been obliged to set off in false Colours. Besides,
Mr._ Whitworth _is since dead, so that the Captain has no Vouchers
but himself and his Brother; and how little Credit they deserve will
sufficiently appear by what follows._




                              THE
                           NARRATIVE.


The _Nottingham-Galley_ of 120 Tons, 10 Guns, and 14 Men, _John Dean_
Commander, took in part of her Lading in the River _Thames_, which
was Cordage, and the rest in Butter and Cheese, at _Killybags_ in
_Ireland_. But Captain _Dean_ in his Narrative has omitted to acquaint
the World that 4 of the Guns were useless, and that not above 6 of the
Men were capable to Serve in the Ship, in case of bad Weather. She
Sail'd from _Gravesend_ the 2d Day of _August_, 1710. to the _Nore_,
and from thence on the 7th, with 2 Men of War, and several Merchant-Men
under their Convoy, towards _Scotland_. When we came off of _Whitby_,
the Fleet brought to, and several of the Ships were a-stern. We having
a fine Gale, the Captain said he would Run it, and make the best of his
way for _Ireland_, which we did. And when we were on that Coast, the
12th of _August_, we saw 2 Ships in a Bay, towards whom the Captain
would have bore down, but the Men would not consent to it, because they
perceiv'd them to be _French_ Men of War. Upon this we stood off to Sea
till 12 at Night; when the Captain coming upon Deck, we Sail'd easily
in towards the Shore, by the Mate's Advice, till Daylight, and came so
near Land that we were forced to stand off. The next Day we saw the
two Privateers again, and the Captain propos'd to stand down towards
them, or to come to an Anchor; but the Mate and the Men oppos'd it.
The Captain was seconded in this by _Charles Whitworth_ the Merchant,
who said in the hearing of the Boatswain, and others, _That he had
rather be taken than otherwise, tho' he had an Eighth Part of the Ship,
because he had Insured_ 200 l. And the Captain said, _He had rather
run the Ship ashore than perform his Voyage, if he thought he could be
safe with the Insurers, because his Brother had insur'd_ 300 l. _upon
her_. Accordingly he put in towards the Shore, to find out a proper
Place for that purpose, and ordered the Boatswain to get the Tackle
upon the Boat and hoist her overside, that she might be in readiness
to go ashore. At the same time the Captain and _Charles Whitworth_ went
to the Cabbin to get out the best of their Goods in order to carry them
with them; and putting them up in a Chest, commanded the Men to carry
them into the Boat, which they did. The Captain promis'd that we should
want for nothing, and resolv'd to go ashore; so that we all plainly
saw he was resolv'd to lose the Ship. But he was opposed by the Mate
_Christopher Langman_, who wrought the Vessel through between the Main
and an Island, and she arriv'd safely at _Killybags_ in _Ireland_ that
same night.

We took in the rest of our Lading there the 25th of _September_, being
30 Tons of Butter, and above 300 Cheeses, and sail'd for _Boston_ in
_New-England_; which we were very uncapable to do, because the Captain,
by his barbarous Treatment of our Men, had disabled several of 'em,
and particularly two of our best Sailors were so unmercifully beat by
him, because they oppos'd his Design abovemention'd, that they were not
able to work in a Month. This gave us a very melancholy Prospect of an
unfortunate Voyage, since we perceiv'd he would either lose the Ship,
or betray her to the _French_, because she was insured for much above
the Value. Besides, he put us to short Allowance, so that we had but
one Quart of Water _per_ Head in twenty four Hours, and had nothing to
eat but salt Beef, which made us so dry that we were forc'd to drink
the Rain Water that run off the Deck. And the Captain was so barbarous
that he knock'd down one of our Men for dead, because when he found the
Hold open, he went and drew a Gallon of Water to quench our Thirst. In
the mean time he wanted nothing himself, tho' he pretended to us that
he confin'd himself also to short Allowance, yet we knew the contrary.

When we came to the Banks of _Newfoundland_ we saw a Ship which made
all the Sail she could towards us, and soon came up with us. The
Captain and Mr. _Whitworth_ hoping she was a _Frenchman_, put on their
best Apparel, and gave us as much strong Beer and Brandy as we could
drink: But it prov'd to be the _Pompey_ Galley of _London_, Captain
_Den_ Commander, at which we rejoic'd, tho' our Captain was melancholy.
We continu'd our Course towards _New England_; and the first Land we
made was _Cape Sables_, which is about 50 Leagues from _Boston_ in that
Country.

We made the best of our way for that Port, but the Wind blew hard, so
that we were several Days without sight of Land, and were forced to
hand all our Sails, and lie under our Mizzen-Ballast till Daylight;
when the Boatswain having the Morning Watch discover'd Land to the
Leeward, with which he acquainted the Captain and the Mate, who both
came upon Deck. The Captain said that was the first Land we had made,
wherein he was justly contradicted by the Mate, which caus'd some Words
between 'em: For in Truth we made Cape _Sables_ a Week before; and
if we had kept our Course then, according to the Opinion of the Mate
and Ship's Company, we had, in all Probability, arriv'd safe the next
Day at _Boston_, but the Master laying the Ship by, and the next Day
proving moderate Weather, and the Wind coming to the West, we stood
away to the North, and so it was a Week before we made Cape _Porpus_,
which was the same Day we were lost; so untrue is it what the Captain
says, that the first Land we made was to the East of _Piscataqua_.
After those Words had pass'd with the Mate, the Captain went down to
serve us with Water, according to Custom, and in the mean time the
Captain's Brother took a Bottle of Water from the Mate, and struck him;
upon which the Captain coming out of the Hold, he took up a Perriwig
Block, with which he came behind the Mate, and struck him three Blows
on the Head, upon which he fell down and lay as dead for several
Minutes, all in Blood. This was very discouraging to the Seamen, who
durst not speak to him for fear of the like Treatment. Soon after this
barbarous Action we perceiv'd the Ship in Danger by being so near Land;
upon which the Boatswain being on the Watch call'd the Captain, and
the Mate, who being scarce recovered came on the Deck all in Gore, and
told the Captain he had no Business so near the Land, except he had a
Mind to lose the Ship, and therefore desir'd him to hawl further off,
or else he would be ashore that Night. The Captain answer'd, _That he
wou'd not take his Advice though the Ship should go to the Bottom,
threatned to shoot the Mate with a Pistol_, and told him, _he would
do what he pleas'd except they confin'd him to his Cabbin_. It fell
out according as the Mate had said; we run ashoar that Night, being
the _11th_ of _December_, between 8 and 9 a Clock, when the Ship
struck upon _Boon Island_, a Rock three or four Leagues East from
_Piscataqua_. And here the Captain is false again in his Narrative,
when he says _p._ 2. _that he saw the Breakers ahead, upon which he
call'd out to put the Helm hard on the Starboard_; for he was then
undressing himself to go to Bed, according to his usual Custom. When
the Ship struck, the Boatswain told the Captain, _he had made his Words
good, and lost the Ship on purpose, whereas had he taken the Mate's
Advice, he might in all probability have been safe at_ Boston _Ten
Days before_. The Captain bid him hold his Peace, _He was sorry for
what had happen'd, but we must now all prepare for Death, there being
no Probability to escape it_. Upon this several of our Men went on the
Deck, but cou'd not stay there, because the Sea broke in all over the
Ship. Then the Captain, who had been Cursing and Swearing before, began
to cry and howl for Fear of losing his Life. The Boatswain and another
went into the Hold to see if there was any Water there, and finding
there was, we went all into the Cabbin to Prayers, being in hopes the
Ship would lie whole till Daylight. Soon after this the Mate, though
hardly able, went with some others above Deck; for this Surprize made
him forget his Pain. He spoke to the Captain, and told him, _It was
his Business to encourage the Men, and not to dishearten them_: Yet
still he insisted it was impossible for us to save our Lives. However,
the Mate with three others cut down the Main-Mast and Fore-Mast, which
by God's Assistance prov'd the Means of our Preservation; for the
Fore-Mast fell on the Rock with one End, and the other rested on the
Ship. The Mate went afterwards into the Cabbin, and desired the Captain
to use his Endeavours to save the Men, for the Ship would immediately
sink, and it was not time to think of saving any thing, but to get
ashore as light as we cou'd. By this Time the Water came out of the
Hold, and the Sea beat over the Deck, so that there was no standing
upon it. The Mate got first on the Mast, and with great Difficulty
escap'd to the Rock. He was follow'd by two others, who likewise got
on Shore, but were scarce able to stand on the Rock, from whence they
hallow'd to us to follow them, and we not hearing them any more than
once, were afraid they were wash'd off by the Waves. This put us into
a mighty Consternation, so that we knew not whether it were best to
follow them, or to stay on board till it was Day. The Captain was for
the latter; but it being dead low Water, the Tide of Flood coming on,
and the Wind beginning to blow hard, the Sea beat into the Cabbin while
we were at Prayers, which forced us to go upon Deck: Some more of our
Men escap'd to the Shore by help of the Mast, as the others had done,
and call'd to us to make haste and follow them, which we did, and by
the Blessing of God got safe to the Rock, though not without much
Danger, being forced to crawl upon our Hands and Knees we were so heavy
with Water, and the Rock so slippery.

Here again the Captain is false in the second Page of his Narrative;
for he neither call'd us down to Prayers, nor order'd us up again, nor
did he either command or assist at cutting down the Mast. We know not
whom he points at, where he says, several of the Company did so sink
under Racks of Conscience, that they were not able to stir; for he
himself had as great Reason to be under Terror of Conscience as any
Man, since he was the Cause of all our Misfortunes. Accordingly he
cryed heartily, and begg'd the Mate to do what he cou'd to save us,
for he himself cou'd do nothing. Nor was the Captain ever upon the
Deck but once, when he held by the Long-Boat, cryed out, and presently
went down again, which greatly discouraged us, so that had it not been
for the Mate, _&c._ who cut down the Shrowds, _&c._ as abovemention'd,
we had all perish'd. He is also unjust to the Mate in his third Page,
where he says, _That one of the Men went out on the Boltsprit, and
returning, told the Captain he saw something black ahead, and would
adventure to get on Shore, accompanied with any other Person_; upon
which the Captain pretends he desired some of his best Swimmers, the
Mate and one more, to go with him, and if they recover'd the Rock, to
give Notice by their Calls, and direct the rest to the most secure
Place; for it was the Mate who went on the Boltsprit and discover'd
the Land. After which he desired the Captain and the rest to go ashore
before he attempted it himself; but finding them all dead-hearted, the
Mate, who cou'd not swim, as the Captain alledges, got on Shore by the
Mast as abovemention'd. The Captain is also false in asserting that he
attempted to save his Money, Brandy, Ammunition, _&c._ for our Relief,
since he had not the Value of one Guinea aboard in Money. It is equally
false that he tore his Arms and Fingers in such a lamentable manner in
climbing up the Rock; for not one Man was hurt in getting ashore. Nor
was the Captain in danger of being wash'd off from the Yard, the Water
there being no deeper than our Middle.

When we got ashore we found it to be a desolate small Island, without
any Shelter; and being wet, and having but few Clothes, some began to
despair of being able to live there till the Morning; and besides, we
were not certain but it might be over flow'd at high Tide. We comforted
our selves however, the best we cou'd, and though we expected to perish
there, return'd God Thanks for giving us some more Time to repent. In
this dismal Condition we continued till next Morning, without any thing
to refresh us: But being in hopes that the Wreck would remain till
Daylight, and that we might recover some of our Provisions, we sent a
Man down to see what was become of her, but he brought us Word that he
cou'd see nothing of her. When Daylight came we went to look for the
Wreck in a cold and hungry Condition; but found nothing except one half
Cheese, entangled in a Piece of a Rope, and this we equally distributed
among us. Soon after we found a Piece of fine Linnen and Canvas, of
which we endeavour'd to make a Tent, and effected it at last by the
help of the Boatswain the second Day, and this preserv'd us from being
all frozen to Death, as our Cook was in a little Time to our very great
Grief, since we look'd upon it as a certain Presage that we should all
have the same Fate. We carried the Corpse to the Seaside, from whence
it was soon wash'd off by the Flood. Here the Captain publishes another
Falshood in his fifth Page, when he says _he knew where he was_; for
he declared to us that he knew not: Nor is there any more Truth in the
Compassion he there alledges that he shew'd to the Cook when he was a
dying.

When the Weather clear'd we discover'd the main Land, which we suppos'd
to be about a League from us. This fill'd us with Hopes that by the
Providence of God we should soon be deliver'd, for which we return'd
him Thanks, and immediately set about building a Boat out of part of
the Wreck which was drove ashore, and heartily pray'd, that God would
give us Success. We were so cold, hungry and feeble, that it was scarce
possible for us to do any thing, nor could we walk on the Rock in order
to keep us warm, it was so craggy, uneven and slippery. We made shift
however to finish our Boat, the Bottom of which was made of Three
Planks, and the Side was Half a Plank High. We cork'd and lin'd it with
Canvas the best we could, and made it about Twelve Foot Long and Four
Foot Wide, thinking it sufficient to hold Six of us.

After this some Controversie happen'd who the Six should be. The
Carpenter pleaded his Right to be one, because he built it; the Captain
pleaded to be another, which was agreed to; and the Boatswain was
thought fit to be one, because he spoke the _Indian_ Language; but at
last it was concluded that the Mate, the Captain's Brother, _Charles
Whitworth_, and _George White_, should be the Men; and we carried the
Boat to the Shore, where we launch'd her, putting on Board such of the
Carpenter's Tools as we had sav'd from the Wreck, in order to build a
better when we came on Shore. We begg'd the Assistance and Direction
of God, and some of our Company went into the Boat, taking leave of
the rest, and promising to bring them Relief as soon as possible. But
the Boat overset, by which our Men were almost drown'd, and narrowly
escaped again to the Rock. The Boatswain held the Boat almost an Hour
with a Rope in hopes to save her till the Weather grew more calm, and
the Gunner came to his Assistance, but soon after she was stav'd to
pieces, which was a great Mortification to us. We thank'd God however
that he was pleas'd again to preserve so many of us, tho' the Time for
our Relief was not yet come. The Captain is out in his Account, _pag.
7._ when he says, our Boat had a Mast and a Sail, for she had neither.

The Wind blowing hard, and there being a great Snow, we betook our
selves to Prayer, and earnestly begg'd that God would have mercy on us,
and consider our deplorable Condition. Being wet with our Endeavours
to launch the Boat, our Cloaths freezed to our Backs, which proved
fatal to our Carpenter, who died a few Days after. The next Day prov'd
fair Weather, so that we could see the Houses on the main Land, and
several Boats rowing to and fro, which rejoyc'd us very much; and after
praying that God might direct some of them to us, we shew'd our selves
on several Places of the Rock, and hallow'd to them, but they could
not hear us. This quite discourag'd us again, for we had no Provisions
but some small pieces of Cheese, four or five pieces of Beef, and one
Neats Tongue that we recover'd out of the Wreck, and a small quantity
of this was distributed among us every Morning when we went round the
Rock to see if it would please God to send us any further Provisions.
At last _George White_, one of our Number, found some Muscles at Low
Water, for which we return'd God Thanks, and we found about as many for
two or three days as six or seven came to each Man's share; but the
Weather was so cold, and the Tides fell out so late in the Night that
we could get no more. The Captain then told us, _We must shift for our
selves, there being nothing now for us to trust to but the Mercies of
God_. There being a piece of a Cows Hide on the Fore Yard of the Wreck,
we cut it into small pieces and swallow'd it down, which reviv'd us a
little. Some of our Company got Sea Weed, which was also shar'd among
us, and this was all the Entertainment we had for several Days; but
still we liv'd in hopes of being deliver'd from this dismal Place; and
the Captain told us, _If we were, he would sell the Cables, Anchors
and Guns that were cast ashore, for our Maintenance_. In this Distress
our Mate perceiving a large Sea Gull in a Hole of the Rock, he knock'd
it down with the Handle of a Sawce Pan, brought her into the Tent, and
shar'd her among us, to our great Relief.

Perceiving no hopes of any Boats coming to us, a stout _Dutchman_,
one of our Company, propos'd the making of a Raft, and proffer'd to
endeavour to get ashore with it himself, if no body else would. This
Proposal being well relish'd, such of us as were able clear'd the
Fore Yard of the Rigging with a great deal of Trouble, for want of
sufficient Strength and necessary Instruments; and having split it in
two to make the Sides of the Raft, and fastning the End pieces with
Nails, we put a Plank in the Middle, with a Mast, and a Sail made of
two Hammocks, and accordingly launch'd her, with _George White_ and
the _Dutchman_ upon it, giving them Orders, if they got ashore, to
acquaint the People with our Distress, and to beg their hastening to
our Assistance. But the Raft overset, by which the Men were almost
drown'd, so that none would venture upon it again except the _Dutchman_
and another. We pray'd heartily for their Success, and saw them paddle
along till the Sun was down, and they appear'd to us to be so near the
Shore, that we hoped they might Land safely.

That Night it blew very hard, and the next Day our Carpenter died as
abovemention'd, and in the Morning we hawl'd him out of the Tent. That
same Day the Captain and _George White_ went out to see what they could
find, but return'd empty handed.

Upon this the Captain propos'd the fleying and eating of the
Carpenter's dead Body, and told us, _It was no Sin, since God was
pleas'd to take him out of the World and that we had not laid violent
Hands upon him_. He ask'd the Boatswain to help to skin and cut him
up, which he refus'd because of his Weakness; whereupon one _Charles
Gray_ help'd the Captain to do it, and brought in several pieces of the
Corps into the Tent, where some of our Men eat of it; but the Mate, the
Boatswain, and _George White_ would not touch any of it till next Day
that they were forced to it by Extremity of Hunger.

Here the Captain is guilty of several Heads, and particularly _pag.
11_, _&c._ for he was so far from offering to go ashore on the Raft,
that he said, _Let who will go, 'twas all one to him_. Nor did the
_Dutchman_ or _Swede_ ever desire the Captain to go with him or help
him to turn the Raft; nor did the Captain assist _George White_ to get
ashore when he was overset in the Raft. It is likewise false, that the
other Man who went off in the Raft was found dead with a Paddle fastned
to his Wrist, for his Corps was found about 300 Yards from the Shore,
and no Paddle to his Wrist. 'Tis likewise false, that the Captain went
several times out alone to look for Provisions, for _George White_
was always with him. Nor is it true, that the piece of Cow's Hide
beforemention'd was brought into the Tent by the Captain's Order, for
_George White_ brought it without his Knowledge. It is likewise false,
that the Men first requested the Carpenter's dead Body of the Captain
to eat, for he himself was the first that propos'd it, and the Three
Deponents refus'd to eat any of it until the next Morning that the
Captain brought in some of his Liver and intreated 'em to eat of it;
so that the Captain's Pretensions of being moved with Horror at the
Thoughts of it, are false, for there was no Man that eat more of the
Corps than himself. It is likewise false, that any of the Men removed
the dead Body from the Place where they laid it at first. It is also
untrue, that the Captain order'd his Skin, Head, Hands, _&c._ to be
buried in the Sea, for these we left on the Island when we came off.
Nor is there any more Truth in the Care which the Captain ascribes to
himself, in hindring us to eat too much of the Corps lest it should
prejudice our Health, for we all agreed, the Night before we come off,
to limit our selves, lest our Deliverers should be detain'd from coming
to us. And as to our Tempers being alter'd after the eating of humane
Flesh, as the Captain charges us, _p. 16._ we can safely declare, that
tho' he says, _There was nothing to be heard among us but brutish
Quarrels, with horrid Oaths and Imprecations_, all the Oaths we heard
were between the Captain, his Brother, and Mr. _Whitworth_, who often
quarrel'd about their Lying and Eating. And whereas the Captain often
went to Prayers with us before we had the Corps to eat, he never, to
our hearing, pray'd afterwards, but behav'd himself so impiously, that
he was many times rebuked by the Mate and others for profane Swearing.

Having agreed with the Men we sent off on the Raft, that they should
kindle a Fire if they got safe on Shore, we were rejoic'd upon the
sight of a Smoke, hoping that had been the Signal they promis'd, but
it was not. Soon after that we perceiv'd a Boat coming towards us,
which made our Hearts leap for Joy, and we return'd Thanks to God for
the Prospect of a speedy Deliverance. The Boat came to an Anchor along
the side of the Rock, but could not get ashore; and we call'd to 'em
for Fire, which the Master sent us by one of his Men in a small Canoe,
but no Provisions. This was the 22d Day after we had been on this
desolate Rock, so that the Man was frighten'd at the sight of so dismal
a Spectacle. We all got about him, and cryed for Joy. He told us, that
the Reason of their coming to the Rock to see for us, was their finding
a Raft on the Shore, with one Man frozen to Death about Two or Three
Hundred Yards from it, but they heard nor saw nothing of the other,
from whence 'twas supposed that the Man found dead ashore having landed
there in the Night Time, and not knowing where to go, he was frozen
to Death under a Tree where they found him. After this Discourse, our
Captain went to go off in the Boat, but it overset, so that we were
forc'd to take up the Canoe, and carry it all over the Rock, to seek
for a smooth Place to put her off again, which we did after the Man had
staid with us Two or Three Hours. He promised to come with a better
Boat to carry us off, but lost his Vessel as he came near the Shore,
and narrowly escaped with his own and his Mens Lives; upon which he
sent an Express to _Piscataqua_ for Relief to us. This Night we had a
prodigious Storm, but kept a great Fire, which was seen on the Shore,
and prov'd very comfortable to us, both for its Warmth, and by Broiling
Part of the Dead Corps, which made it eat with less Disgust.

The next Day it blowed very fresh, so that no Relief could come to us;
but on the 4th of _January_ in the Morning, the Weather being fair,
several Sloops came towards us, and one Canoe came ashore with Four
Men, Two of which were Captain _Long_ and Captain _Forbe_, Commanders
of Ships, and soon carried us all off on board their Vessel; for
several of us had our Legs so frozen, and were so weak that we could
not walk. These Gentlemen took great Care of us, and would not suffer
us to eat or drink but a little at a time, lest it should do us hurt.
Night we arrived at _Piscataqua_ in _New England_, where we were all
provided for, and had a Doctor appointed to look after us. We were
Ten who came ashore. Two of us having died on the Island, and Two
being lost that were sent off on the Raft. The Names of those that
were sav'd are _John Dean_, Captain; _Christopher Langman_, Mate;
_Christopher Gray_, Gunner; _Nicholas Mellan_, Boatswain; _George
White_, _Charles Whitworth_, _Henry Dean_, _Charles Graystock_,
_William Saver_, and the Captain's Boy, who had Part of his Foot cut
off to prevent a Mortification, and several others were lame. Thus we
were delivered by the Goodness of God (for which we praise his Name)
after we had been Twenty Four Days upon that Desolate Island in the
Distress abovementioned, having nothing to shelter us but a sorry
Tent that could not keep us from wet, and was once in Danger of being
carryed off by the high Tide, which obliged us to remove it to the
highest Part of the Rock. We had nothing to lie on but the Stones, and
very few Cloathes to cover us; which, together with our Hunger, made
our Lives a Burden to us.

Some Days after our Arrival, the Captain drew up a Protest, which was
sign'd by the Mate, being then very ill of a Flux and Fever; and also
by the Boatswain _Geo. White_, who was also ill, and declared that he
did it for fear of being put out of his Lodgings by the Captain, while
he was both sick and lame. But as soon as the Deponents recover'd,
they declar'd the Captain's Protest to be false, _&c._ as may be seen
by the Depositions hereunto annex'd.

The Captain falsly ascribes to himself, _p. 17_, the first Discovery
of the Sloop that came to relieve us, whereas it was first discover'd
by _Christopher Gray_, the Gunner, he being sent out on purpose by
the Mate, who the Night before had dreamt of the Sloop's Arrival. The
Captain likewise falsly magnifies his own Danger of being drowned,
when the Canoe was overset, since the Water then was scarce half a
Yard deep; and instead of being thankful to God for his own and our
Deliverance, he returned with the Dog to his Vomit, and behav'd himself
so brutishly, that his Friend Captain _Purver_ was obliged to turn him
out of his House. He was so little sensible of the Merciful Deliverance
from the Danger he had escaped, that he barbarously told the Children
in his Lodging, he would have made a Frigasy of them if he had had 'em
in _Boon Island_; which frighten'd the People that heard him, and made
them esteem him a Brute, as he was. He likewise wrong'd us of what the
Good People gave us towards our Relief, and applyed it to his own and
his Brother's Use; and particularly when Captain _John Wentworth_ gave
several of our Men good Cloaths, Captain _Dean_ came and order'd them
the worst that could be had, and was likewise so barbarous as to get us
turn'd out of our Lodgings, before we were able to shift for our selves.

All this we avouch to be Truth, and have no other End in publishing it,
but to testify our Thankfulness to God for his Great Deliverance, and
to give others Warning not to trust their Lives or Estates in the Hands
of so wicked and brutish a Man.

For the Truth of what we have deliver'd, we refer to the Affidavits
subjoined, which we made concerning this Matter both in _New England_,
and since our Arrival at _London_.




      _An Account of our intended Voyage, and some Accidents that
    happen'd therein from the River of_ Thames _to_ Ireland, _in the_
                Nottingham-_Galley_, John Dean _Master_.


_August_ the 7th, 1710. we sail'd from the _Nore_ in company with her
Majesty's Ship _Sheerness_, she then being appointed a Convoy for the
_North Britain_ Fleet, which we parted from off of _Whitby_, and made
the best of our Way.

The 21st _ditto_ we saw two Sail, and that they gave chace to us, they
being to the Leeward of us about Three Leagues. It being then the
Master's Watch on the Deck, he called the Mate, and told him, _That he
saw Two Privateers_. As soon as the Mate came on the Deck, he desired
the Master to run in Shore to the Windward of the Island of _Arran_, we
then being about Two Leagues to the Windward of it. But the said Master
would have gone in to Leeward, which we could not have done without
speaking with the aforesaid Ships; and he proposed it several times;
but the Mate nor none of the Ship's Company would consent to it, but
told him, _That if he did, we could not possibly escape the Enemy_.
_Charles Whitworth_ then said in the hearing of the Boatswain and some
others of the Ship's Company, _That he had rather be taken than not,
for he had Two Hundred Pounds Insured_; he having an Eighth Part of the
Ship, as he said.

The Master the next Day would have gone ashore and left the Ship,
and put a Chest and several other things in the Boat. The Mate told
him, _That he would not consent to any such Thing, for he then saw no
Danger of being Taken_, and told the said Master, _That it was early
in the Morning, and but Seven Leagues from our Port, and a fair Wind
to run along the Shore_. The said Master was then heard to say by the
Boatswain and several of the Ship's Company, _That if he thought the
Insurance would be paid, he would immediately run her ashore_. So that
we all plainly saw that he was willing to lose the said Ship. The
Mate told him, _That if he would, by God's Assistance he might fetch
his Port before Night, if he would make Sail; but he had a Design to
give the Ship away, he might_. The said Master found the Mate was not
willing to what he proposed, and that he could not obtain his Desire,
he made Sail, and about Six or Seven in the Evening we arrived at our
desired Port _Killybags_, where we took in 30 Tons of Butter and 300
and odd Cheeses.

_September 25, 1710._ we sail'd from this Port, bound for _Boston_ in
_New England_.

_December 11, 1710._ we being then on the Coast of _New England_, and
close on Board of _Cape Porpus_, the Mate told him, _That he did not
know any business we had so nigh the Shore, and that it was his better
way to hawl further to the Southward_. The said Master would not take
his Advice if the Ship went to the Bottom.

At or about Eight this Morning the said Master came to the Mate and
knock'd him down with a Block, such as Barbers make Wigs on. We all
thought that he had kill'd him, for he lay dead some time, and lost a
great deal of Blood.

Between Eight and Nine this Night the Ship run ashore, the Wind at
E. S. E. and a moderate Gale. The Mate being then in his Cabbin, and
hardly done bleeding, got on the Deck, tho' badly able, and ordered the
Masts to be cut away, which we did, and by God's Assistance got all
ashore, it being a desolate Land, about Three Leagues from the Main. We
then steer'd W. and by S. so that if we had miss'd it we should have
run ashore on the Main. This Island is called by the Name of _Boon
Island_. We remained on it Twenty-four Days, and suffered a great deal
of Hardship; at which time we were fetched off by a _Piscataqua_ Boat,
and carried ashore.

Some Days after the Master drew up a Protest, which the Mate and
Boatswain signed, the Mate being then very ill with a Flux and Fever,
and the Boatswain and _George White_ declares, That the Protest was
false, and hardly a Word of Truth in it, but for fear of being put out
of his Lodging, he then being very Sick and Lame, sign'd it.

As soon as the Mate recover'd, we all and every of us declare, and give
our Oath, That this is the real Truth, and the said Master's Protest
to be false; which we now before the Worshipful Justice of the Peace
disavow and give our Oaths, That this is the Truth and that if the said
Master had taken the Mate's Advice, the Ship, with God's Assistance,
might have been in _Boston_ Harbour several Days before she was lost.

                                          _Christopher Langman_, Mate.
                                          _Nicholas Mellin_, Boatswain.
                                          _George White_, Sailor.

Christopher Langman, Nicholas Mellin, _and_ George White, _personally
appeared before me the Subscriber, one of Her Majesty's Justices of
the Peace at_ Portsmouth _in the Province of_ New Hampshire _in_
New England, _and Member of Council within the same, this 9th Day
of_ February, 1710-11. _and made Oath to the Truth of what is above
written, Captain_ Dean _at the time of taking this Oath being present_.

                                                      Samuel Penhallow.

_Christopher Langman_, late Mate of the late Ship called the
_Nottingham_, of the Burden of about 120 Tons, whereof _John Dean_
was Master, _Nicholas Mellon_ Boatswain, and _George White_ Sailor,
all belonging to the said Ship, do severally make Oath as followeth,
_viz._ And first, the said _Christopher Langman_ for himself saith,
The said Ship being designed on a Voyage from _London_ to _Killybags_,
and from thence to _New England_, she departed from the _Nore_, the
7th of _August_, 1710. in company with her Majesty's Ship _Sheerness_,
which they left off of _Whitby_. That on the 21st of the same Month
they saw Two Sail to the Leeward, which gave chace to the said Ship
_Nottingham_ for about the Space of Three Leagues; in which time,
(notwithstanding this Deponent told the said _Dean_ they were Enemies)
he often would have bore down upon them; that the Day fallowing they
saw the Privateers again, when the said _John Dean_ (contrary to the
Will of this Deponent) would have brought the said Ship _Nottingham_ to
an Anchor; which if done, she would in all probability have been taken.
That they then left the said Privateers, and arrived with their said
Ship that Night at _Killybags_ aforesaid, where they deliver'd what
Goods were thereto consigned. That on the 25th Day of _September_, in
the Year aforesaid, they departed with the said Ship _Nottingham_ from
the said Port for _Boston_ in _New England_. In Prosecution of which
Voyage, being on the Coast of _New England_, the said _John Dean_,
without any Provocation, came to this Deponent and knock'd him down
after a very barbarous and inhumane manner, and between Eight and Nine
of the Clock at Night of the same Day, the said Ship _Nottingham_ was
run on Shore on the Coast of _New England_, (contrary to the Advice
of this Deponent) where she, with the chiefest Part of her Cargo, was
utterly lost. And lastly, This Deponent believeth, that the said _John
Dean_, according to his Working of the said Ship in the said Voyage,
design'd to lose her.

                                                 _Christopher Langman._

And the said _Nicholas Mellin_ for himself saith, That the several
Allegations, Matters and Things contained in the aforegoing Deposition
of _Christopher Langman_, are just and true in every Particular
thereof. And this Deponent saith, That at the Time they were chased
by the said Privateers he was present, and did hear Mr. _Charles
Whitworth_ (then on board the said Ship, and adjudged Part Owner
thereof) say, _That he would rather the said Ship should be lost than
obtain her design'd Port in Safety, having made 200 l. Insurance_.
And this Deponent saith, _That the said_ John Dean _at the same time
declared, That his Brother_ Jasper Dean _had made 300 l. Insurance_;
and immediately after said, _If he thought he could secure the
Insurance, he would run the Ship on Shore_; and upon the same order'd
this Deponent to hoist the Boat over the Side of the Ship, which done,
the said _John Dean_ put therein all his valuable Effects, with a
Design to run the said Ship on Shore, but was prevented by the Deponent
_Christopher Langman_, by whose Assistance the said Ship arrived at her
Port of _Killybags_, and having reloaded departed for _Boston_ in _New
England_, upon which Coast making the Land, the Deponent being on the
Watch, call'd up the said _John Dean_, and told him there was Land just
to the Leeward of them, and the Deponent _Christopher Langman_ being
call'd up also, desired the said Ship might be put off from the Shore,
which the said _John Dean_ refus'd _if she went to the Bottom_; and for
the said _Langman's_ Advice threatned to fetch up a Pistol and shoot
him, and did go down, and came up behind him and knock'd him down with
a Loggerhead, by means whereof he lay dead for several Minutes, and
the same Night the said Ship _Nottingham_ run ashore upon a desolate
Rock, and was stav'd in Pieces; And this Deponent saith, _That if the
Ship had missed that Misfortune, she would have run ashore on the Main
Land_, which he believes was the Master's Design: And on the said
Rock we should have been lost our selves, had not the Mate _Langman_,
who was then bleeding and cutting down the Mast (under God) sav'd our
Lives; in which Island the Cook was frozen to Death, and the Carpenter
dying next having been reduced to Hunger, the Master skinned him and
cut him up, and they eat him, when Two of the Ship's Company went on
Shore on a Raft; one of which was never heard of, the other was found
dead in the Woods, by which means the Country understanding a Wreck,
came off with a Shallop, whereby they had a Fire after the 22d Day,
with which they broiled the rest of the Man, until the 24th Day after
their being arrived on the Island before they were relieved.

                                                    _Nicholas Mellen._

And the said _George White_ for himself saith, That on the _7th_ of
_August 1710_, they departed with the said Ship _Nottingham_ from
the _Nore_, on the Voyage to _Killybags_ and _New England_, that in
Prosecution of the Voyage on the _21st_ Day of _August_, in the Year
aforesaid, there appear'd off the Coast of _Ireland_ two Ships to the
Leeward, to which the said _John Dean_ would have bore down, but that
the Deponent _Langman_ and the Men believ'd they were Privateers, and
advis'd to the contrary, and would not consent to his bearing down.
And this Deponent saith, That Mr. _Charles Whitworth_, then on board
the said Ship, and said to be a Part Owner thereof, declared, That he
had rather be taken than not; and the next Day the said Master _John
Dean_ would have run the said Ship _Nottingham_ on Shore, provided he
thought the Insurance would be paid, and then declared his Brother had
300 _l._ assured, and _Mr. Whitworth_ 200 _l._ assured, and, so put out
some Goods into the Boat (which was then in the Tackle) to save, altho
the Deponent _Langman_ and the Men declared the said Ship was within so
small a way of her Port, and might escape, which she did accordingly.
That after her departure from _Killybags_, when she came on the Banks
of _Newfoundland_ was chaced by the _Pompey_. Captain _Den_, at which
the said _John Dean_ and Mr. _Whitworth_ seem'd to rejoice, believing
him a Privateer; but proving otherwise, they appeared disappointed.
That when they came on the Coast of _New England_, falling in with Cape
_Porpus_, the Mate and the Men declared that it was not convenient
to stand in for the Shore, but to bear away to the Southward. That
upon some Words arising _John Dean_ with a Perriwig Block struck the
Mate _Christopher Langman_ Three Blows on the Head, which made him
lie bleeding. That the same Day the said Ship _Nottingham_ was run
ashore upon a most desolate Island, call'd _Boon Island_, (which had
they miss'd they must have run ashore on the main Land in a few Hours,
which makes this Deponent believe in his Conscience the said Ship was
designed to be lost) where the Men had been lost had not the Mate, who
was then bleeding, came on Deck, and the Mast being cut down, under
God saved their Lives. In which Island one of their Company, being the
Cook, died, and the Carpenter dying next, they being reduced to Hunger,
eat him, when Two of the Ship's Company went on Shore with a small
Rafter, one was never heard of, the other was found dead in the Woods,
by which the Country understanding a Wreck, came off with a Canoe,
whereby they had Fire after the 22d Day, by which they broil'd the rest
of the Man until the 24th Day after their being on the Island before
relieved.

                                                        _George White._
